About INI File
---------------------

Since the character encoding of INI files of Ver.1.98 or later was changed,
INI files saved by Ver.1.97b or earlier could not be loaded.
But Ver.1.98b or later can load them again.

Ver.1.97b or earlier cannot load INI files saved by Ver.1.98 or later.
Please change to save the settings to the registry instead of the INI file
before reverting to Ver.1.97b or earlier.


About Master Password
---------------------

FFFTP Ver.1.96d+009 or later (including this version) introduce Master 
Password feature. 
When you use this virsion first, please set Master Password from 
following menu.

File ->@Settings -> Change Master password


Changes in Ver.1.99
--------------------

-- Tested on Windows 8.1 (32bit/64bit).

-- 64bit version is now available.
   This works around the certain restriction on 64bit Windows.

-- Added the feature of automatic software update.
   It will connect to the dedicated server to check whether there are updates
   every 7 days by default, and then confirm whether to apply them.

-- Added a feature to encrypt the all settings with the master password.
   This prevents malwares and third parties from skimming personal information.
   Please note that 1.98g or former versions cannot read encrypted settings.
   This feature is disabled by default.

-- Fixed bugs that the apprication did not start when the INI file was modified
   and BOM was inserted in it.

-- Fixed bugs that user names which were sent to hosts were always encoded into
   UTF-8.

-- Fixed bugs of recognition of MLSD responses that include uppercase letters.

-- Added an option to disable automatic refresh of the local view.

-- Added an option to dispose old logs automatically.

-- Supported UTF-8 HFS+ file name encoding (Windows Vista or later only).

-- Improved automatic detection of Kanji code of filenames.

-- Fixed bugs of Select dialog.

-- Changed to confirm how the settings will be saved when the settings of a
   future version exist in the registry.

-- Changed to display file sizes with units of GB or larger.

-- Changed to display the encryption status of the current connection.

-- Changed to display the progress of file transfer on the taskbar (Windows 7
   or later only).

-- Added a function to move remote files to their parent directory.

-- Supported high DPI displays.
   The interface such as the menu will look smooth on high DPI displays.

-- Added a feature to export settings as FileZilla XML format.

-- Added an option not to use weak encryption methods for each host.
   This refuses SSL 3.0 or older and encryption algorithms whose keys are
   shorter than 128 bits.
   This feature is enabled by default.

-- Added the default settings to the host list.
   This is used for the initial state of new hosts and Quick Connect.

-- Added an option to abort file transfer if failed in obtaining file lists
   before it.
   This feature is enabled by default.

-- Changed to enable reconnection after transfer errors by default.
